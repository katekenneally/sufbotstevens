Twitter bot featuring random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufjan_Stevens">Sufjan Stevens</a> lyrics

<br>
sufbot is <a href="https://twitter.com/sufbotstevens">@sufbotstevens</a> on twitter. This was a learning experience for me in working with HTML scraping and Twitter applications. As such, much of his code (particularly the sufbot.py file) is based on <a href="https://twitter.com/bgporter">@bgporter</a>'s code for <a href="https://twitter.com/tmbotg">@tmbotg</a>, a They Might Be Giants twitter bot featuring some extra functionality that sufbot does not currently have (for example, favoriting and responding to replies from other twitter users).

Currently, sufbot operates via a cron job on my laptop, and consequently only tweets when my laptop is actually open. I ran into some difficulties setting up hosting through Heroku and will look into this in the future!
